Welcome to Safe Queue. 
Check out our site at http://safe-queue.herokuapp.com.

Have you been to crowded stores before? If so, you should know that it becomes a nuisance to buy the merchandise you need and wait for over 30 minutes to check out from the store.

Due to the corona virus epidemic, these situations are especially dangerous for customers because they come into contact with several other people while shopping and cannot necessarily protect themselves from catching the virus.

This is the problem safe queue addresses. Safe Queue protects customers by moving the experience online. That's right. Safe Queue creates a virtual queue through the help of our Count Engine to provide our customers with a real-time updating Map containing crowd information about each store so customers can make wiser decisions on when to go to the store. This way, we reduce the spread of the virus and also facilitate the shopping experience for our customers!
